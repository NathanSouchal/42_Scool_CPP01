# C++ Module 01

This repository contains the second module of the **42 C++ Piscine**, focused on memory, references, pointers, and class-level manipulation.

---

## Objectives

- Deepen understanding of stack vs heap memory
- Work with **references and pointers**
- Practice **dynamic allocation** (`new` / `delete`)
- Use classes with encapsulation
- Understand object **lifecycle** and memory management
- Use C++ idioms like **passing by reference**

---

## Concepts Covered

- References (`&`)
- Pointers (`*`)
- `new` and `delete`
- Const correctness
- Object copying
- Shallow vs Deep copy (start of the idea)
- Scope and object lifetime
